# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release security updates for the most recent major version and, where practical, the latest patch release of the previous major version.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| Latest major (current) | ✅ |
| Previous major (latest patch) | ✅ |
| Older versions | ❌ |

If you are unsure which version you are running, please include the output of your version command (or commit SHA) in your report.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately** and **do not** open a public GitHub issue, discussion, or pull request for vulnerabilities.

### Preferred method: GitHub Security Advisories
Use **“Report a vulnerability”** in this repository’s **Security** tab:
- Go to the repository → **Security** → **Report a vulnerability**
- Provide the details requested below

### If GitHub private reporting is unavailable
If private reporting is not enabled for any reason, open a minimal GitHub issue that says you attempted to report a security issue and request a private contact method **without including any sensitive details**.

### What to include
To help us triage quickly, include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability and its impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept is helpful, but keep it safe and minimal)
- Affected versions, configuration details, and environment
- Any known mitigations or workarounds
- Whether the issue is likely exploitable by a remote, unauthenticated attacker
- Your preferred credit name (if you want acknowledgement)

### Response and triage timeline
We aim to:
- Acknowledge receipt within **3 business days**
- Provide an initial triage assessment within **7 business days**
- Share progress updates at least every **14 days** until resolved or closed

Timelines may vary depending on severity, complexity, and maintainer availability.

### Coordinated disclosure
We follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure practices:
- Please allow us a reasonable window to investigate and release a fix before public disclosure
- If you believe disclosure is time-sensitive, tell us why and we will coordinate a mutually agreeable timeline

### Severity and fixes
Severity is assessed using common industry practice (often aligned with CVSS), considering real-world impact and exploitability.

When a report is accepted, we will typically:
- Confirm the issue and affected versions
- Develop and test a fix
- Publish a security advisory and release notes
- Credit the reporter if requested (and if appropriate)

If a report is declined, we will explain why (for example: not a security issue, already fixed, or not exploitable in supported configurations).

## Safe harbour
We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:
- Make a good-faith effort to follow this policy
- Avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption
- Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it
- Give us a reasonable opportunity to remediate before public disclosure

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe.
